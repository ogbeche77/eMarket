      "Daihatsu is an one-off concept car that was shown at the 26th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2018. It is based on the 1.2 L version of the standard Ayla. The two-tone red and black exterior colour is partially inspired from the 1984 Charade de Tomaso Turbo. The front and rear bumper design has also been redesigned. The 1.2 L 3NR-VE engine has been extensively modified by fitting a turbocharger that is equipped with intercooler, wastegate and blow-off valve with 0.5 bar (7.3 psi) of boost that uprates the power output to 147 kW (197 hp; 200 PS) and torque to 242 N⋅m (178 lbf⋅ft). Further engine changes include the use of low-compression piston, dual fuel injector, open air filter and stronger connecting rod. The 3-module piggyback has been used to manipulate the engine data for performance orientation, while the exhaust system uses a stainless steel free-flow type with 63.5 mm (2.5 in) of diameter. The interior has been stripped down in order to gain lower weight and the roll cage has been added, along with FIA-certified Sparco racing bucket seats. The AC and other unnecessary features has also been removed",

On June 4, 2017, Audi stated that its new A8 will be fully self-driving for speeds up to 60 km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15 seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first production car to reach level 3 autonomous driving, meaning that the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks",
